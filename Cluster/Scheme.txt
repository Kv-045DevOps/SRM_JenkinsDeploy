Here I will describe the minimal set of cluster components:

1. Master node consist of:
API - just REST api which in charge of communiation with your cluster for further configuring from outside network.
Kubectl command communicate with master API part.
Kube-controller-manager - service which regulate the system state. It watching the state of cluster through the API and makes changes towards the desired state.
kube-scheduler
etcd - databse

2. Nodes:

kubelet - tool which allow communicate with the Kubernet master
kube-proxy - network proxy which reflects Kubernetes networking services on each node.
